                    During office hours for <b class="coursename">Phys2C</b>, the TA announced that the answer sheet
                    for problem 8 did actually forget to account for a small calculation that I brought up earlier in
                    the week - nice to know my reasoning was sound.

                    Thank god my old roommate asked me how far I was into the first lab for <b class="coursename">ECE65</b>.
                    If he hadn't I feel like I might've forgotten that labs were given out at the frequency of hws and hw
                    assignments were as rare as labs in other classes <i> (maybe might've even forgotten to the lab completely) </i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Also, here's the cool video I found as I browsed through YouTube recommendeds at night:

                    Found out the last chapter of SNK got released. I was expecting the ending to be a timeloop 
                    because of the reference to the memory from the first chapter in chapter 138 but I guess that's 
                    just the ability to see the future. Actually that still doesn't make sense since he had that 
                    vision/dream when he was still a kid, way before he inherited the titan...  
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fixed an old script that worked with Riot's API. A part of the data you got from a match 
                    was timestamp in unix Epoch ms that I was having issues correctly converting it to a date/time.
                    Figured out today that it was UTC based time and had to be converted to PST in addition to
                    adding ms since Jan 1, 1970. Also the reason I went back to fix it in the first place was because 
                    this meme I saw today reminded me about it:

                    That breakfast burrito was pretty good. I wanna try making my own hash browns next time though, I heard 
                    homemade is better than the frozen ones you buy from the supermarket.

                    I think I'm finally starting to get powershell - at least this time I didn't have 7 tabs opened up to figure 
                    out how to get different stuff done. And being able to dot source a script to use it's functions has got to be 
                    one of the most useful things I've found learning powershell.

                    Oh and YouTube recommendeds worked it's magic again. That sax cover of the town theme from Shining Force II 
                    made me really wanna play it again, but the beginning of a new quarter is defitely not the best time to start a 
                    new playthrough. Looking for the original theme I also found another cover - orchestral this time that also 
                    sounded really nice. Here's both of them:
